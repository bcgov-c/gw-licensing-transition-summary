The scripts for generating in the report expect two files to be in this directory, 
which you will need to place there manually:

- `Projected_GW_Transition_Licences_ENVWaterBranch.xlsx`
- `GW_Applications_current.xlsx` - This file will likely have a date in the filename in the source directory, but should be copied into the `data/` folder with this name.

You will need to copy these from a master source directory on the network. This is likely one of:

- soe_data source PATH: `~/soe_data/water/groundwater/licensing/transition/`
- ENV Water data source PATH: `Y:/WPS/Water Strategies/Groundwater Licensing - BIG project/GW Licencing Data/`

The third required file, `regions_matchup.csv`, is already in this folder and should not need to be modified.

The scripts for generating in the report expect three files to be in this directory:


- `Projected_GW_Transition_Licences_ENVWaterBranch.xlsx`
- `GW_Applications_current.xlsx`
- `regions_matchup.csv`

You will need to copy the first two from a master source directory. These are likely one of:

soe_data source PATH
`~/soe_data/water/groundwater/licensing/transition/`

ENV Water data source PATH
`Y:/WPS/Water Strategies/Groundwater Licensing - BIG project/GW Licencing Data/`

`regions_matchup.csv` is already in this folder
